# Longevity prediction
This project was inspired by an off-hand comment by Balaji Srinivasan in his
[podcast with Lex
Fridman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeH7qKZr0WI&ab_channel=LexFridman).

F(picture of face, age) = life exectancy

The methodology is to collect a large dataset of pictures of faces and their dates, along with the
dates of birth and death of the people in the picture. Then train a neural network to predict age of death.

This could be a cool thing people could use to get feedback on their own
health.
