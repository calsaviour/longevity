# Longevity prediction
This project was inspired by an off-hand comment by Balaji Srinivasan in his
[podcast with Lex
Fridman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeH7qKZr0WI&ab_channel=LexFridman).

The goal is to collect a large dataset of pictures of faces, along with the
dates of birth and death of the people in the picture. Once this dataset has
been collected, the idea is to train a neural network to predict the life
expectancy of a person based on the picture of their face.

This could be a cool thing people could use to get feedback on their own
health.
